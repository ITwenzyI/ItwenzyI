# Hi there 👋 I'm Kilian

🎓 I'm a medical informatics student (3nd semester) from Germany with a strong interest in **cybersecurity** and system programming. Currently improving my skills in **C++** and dive deep into **Python** and cybersecurity tools.

🛠️ I use my GitHub to track my learning journey. You'll find a mix of:
- Small university projects in C and C++
- Private C++ projects to experiment with new ideas and improve my skills
- Python scripts
- Lua scripts from early game development experiments in FiveM

🚀 My goal is to work in **IT security**, protecting critical systems from cyber threats.

📚 Next steps:
- Become better in C++ and Python
- Learn SQL

🔗 I'm always looking to learn more and build cool things, so feel free to check out my repositories!
